# Efficient-Page-Replacement-Algorithm-Simulator
Description: Design a simulator that allows users to test and compare different page replacement algorithms (e.g., FIFO, LRU, Optimal). The simulator should provide visualizations and performance metrics to aid in understanding algorithm efficiency.

Introduction:
Welcome to the Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator! 🎉 This interactive tool is designed to help you explore and compare various page replacement algorithms, such as FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal.

By simulating how these algorithms manage memory, you can visualize their performance and understand their efficiency in real-time. Whether you're studying operating systems or looking to enhance your programming skills, this simulator provides valuable insights into memory management strategies. Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of page replacement algorithms! 🚀
